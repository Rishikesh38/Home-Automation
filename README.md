# Home-Automation
- Implemented the Motion Sensor Light, a responsive lighting system that adjusts based on inputs from an Ultrasonic sensor.
- Utilized an Ultrasonic sensor, which employs ultrasonic sound waves to measure the distance to an object, employing a transducer for transmitting and receiving ultrasonic pulses to gather proximity information.
- Detected motion by utilizing the Ultrasonic Sensor, triggering the LED to illuminate when a person passes by or when the presence of a person is detected.
- Implemented varying intensity levels for the LED based on proximity, with the LED glowing with lower intensity when a person is farther away and increasing in intensity as the person gets closer.
- Incorporated a security mode, enabling the Red LED to blink as an alert whenever someone attempts to enter the area.
- Provided user-configurable options, allowing users to set high and low-level intensity, maximum distance, and timeout settings.
- Utilized the STM32F407G DISC1 Board for the operation, employing a TTL 232R cable for serial UART communication, enabling easy user control and parameter adjustments.
